# Stack

## What is a Stack?
- Is a one-ended linear data structure which models a real world stack by having two primary operations, (PUSH and POP)
- LIFO (Last In First Out).

## Where is a stack used?
- Used in undo mechanisms in text editors.
- Used in compiler syntax checking for matching brackets and braces.
- Can be used to model a pile of books or plates.
- Used behind the scenes to support recursion by keeping track of previous function calls. 
- Can be used to do a Depth First Search (DFS) on a graph.

### Complexity
| Operation | Complexity |
| - | - | 
| Pushing | O(1) |
| Popping | O(1) |
| Peeking | O(1) |
| Searching | O(n) |
| Size | O(1) |
